### Workout Tracker

Workout tracker application. I worked along with front end code which required me to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with 

Express.

### User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 


I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 


If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


### Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.


### Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.


The user should be able to:


Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.


Add new exercises to a new workout plan.


View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page.


View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.


To deploy an application with a MongoDB database to Heroku, you'll need to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and connect a database from there to your application. Be sure to use the 


following guides for support:


Set Up MongoDB Atlas


Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas


### Functionality
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.


The user should be able to:


Add exercises to a previous workout plan.


Add new exercises to a new workout plan.


View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page.

### Usage


The application best serves those interested in exercise by allowing users to create workout plans by adding different exercises. This helps users to track their fitness goals.
